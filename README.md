## English language

Since this group is mainly for you to learn English in an English context, i.e., no flash cards, no Chinese translation, Wikipedia is our best friend. We will choose a topic of discussion evey week.
The topic last week was hometown, this week is the English language.
Let's see what we can learn.

English is now a global lingua franca. It is the third most common native language in the world, after Mandarin and Spanish.
English speakers from around the world are able to communicate with one another effectively.
Modern English, sometimes described as the first global lingua franca, is also regarded as the first world language.
English is the world's most widely used language in newspaper publishing, book publishing, international telecommunications, scientific publishing, international trade, mass entertainment, and diplomacy.
English is, by international treaty, the basis for the required controlled natural languages Seaspeak and Airspeak are used as international languages of seafaring and aviation.

Many worldwide international organisations, including the International Olympic Committee, specify English as a working language or official language of the organisation.
Many regional international organisations such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) set English as their organisation's sole working language even though most members are not countries with a majority of native English speakers.
